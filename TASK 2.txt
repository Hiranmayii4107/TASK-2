TASK 2


Sample phishing email

Subject: Urgent: Your Account Will Be Suspended in 24 Hours
From: support@secure-paypal.com
To: user@example.com


1)
Spoofing tactic: Attackers register a lookalike domain to trick users visually.

Legit PayPal domain: paypal.com
Phishing domain used: secure-paypal.com
--> This is not owned by PayPal.
--> It tries to mimic legitimacy using words like ‚Äúsecure‚Äù and ‚ÄúPayPal.‚Äù

2)
Check Email Headers (Technical Check)
In a real email client, view email headers and examine:

Return-Path:
--> Does it match the From address?
--> Often, spoofers use different return addresses.

Received:
--> Shows the real mail servers that sent the email.
--> Look for suspicious, unknown IPs or hostnames.

SPF, DKIM, and DMARC results:
--> These are email authentication mechanisms.
--> A spoofed sender will often fail one or more of them.

3)
Spoofers might use Unicode characters to trick the eye.

4)
Research on the domain of the address.
--> Newly created- likely a phishing email.
--> check if it is linked to any phishing reports.

To conclude:
The sample email address support@secure-paypal.com is likely spoofed or malicious, because:

-->It mimics a legitimate domain.
-->It uses urgency and fear.
-->It links to a non-official domain.
-->It may fail SPF/DKIM/DMARC checks.

Sample Email Body (Phishing Example)
Subject: Urgent: Your Account Will Be Suspended
Dear Customer,
We have detected suspicious activity in your PayPal account. Please verify your account to avoid suspension.
üëâ Verify My Account
Or download the attached form and complete verification:
üìé PayPal_Verification_Form.pdf.exe
Thank you,
‚Äî PayPal Security Team

Link:
http://paypal.com.secure-update-info.com/login
it is suspicious because it contains the word "paypal.com" to trick users, but the actual domain is: secure-update-info.com
This is called a deceptive subdomain attack.
Real PayPal URLs only come from domains like paypal.com or paypalobjects.com.

Suspicious Attachment:
File: PayPal_Verification_Form.pdf.exe
Why it‚Äôs suspicious:
It appears to be a PDF file but ends in .exe ‚Äî an executable program.
This is a common phishing tactic: double extensions to fool users.
If opened, this file could install malware (e.g., keyloggers, ransomware).





Look for urgent or threatening languages and statments






IDENTIFY MISMATCHED URLs:
EXAMPLE:

Link Displayed in Email:
Verify My Account

Actual Hyperlink Destination (on hover or in source code):
http://paypal.com.secure-update-info.com/login




VERIFY SPELLING AND GRAMMATICAL ERRORS:
EXAMPLE:

Dear Customer,

We have detected suspicious activity on your PayPal account. To protect your account from unauthorized access, we have temporarily limited your account access.
Please verify your identity by clicking the link below:
üëâ Verify My Account
If you do not verify your account within 24 hours, it will be permanently suspended.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.

| **1. Fake Sender Address**                          | Uses a domain that mimics a real company                 | `support@secure-paypal.com` (not from `paypal.com`)                       |
| **2. Urgent or Threatening Language**               | Creates panic to force quick action                      | ‚ÄúYour account will be suspended in 24 hours‚Äù                              |
